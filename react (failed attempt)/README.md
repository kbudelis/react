# "React" Assignment

Create a learning resource that gives the user feedback â€“ in other words, responds to the user's input/actions. Actions could include:

* Clicking
* Typing
* Scrolling

or lack of any of those things. Feel free to pick a new subject, or dive deeper with one you've already used.

## Examples

1. [Operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(game)), which uses sound to inform the player they are doing something wrong.

1. An essay helper, where the user needs the their entry in a [`<textarea>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) to have five paragraphs and be 300-500 words.
1. An essay helper which prompts the user to make sure they are still paying attention if they haven't written anything in a few minutes, but has the option to pause (for dinner, bathroom breaks, and The Voice).
